      title: "From Clay, a Kingdom Rose",
      content: `In the autumn of 2017, when lesser mortals played tennis for mere "exercise" and "fun," three visionaries gathered at Court Seven of the municipal facility. Kockum, Viktor and Gerard looked upon the nets and saw not barriers, but thrones.

"We shall create something," Viktor declared, his voice carrying the weight of inevitability, "that transcends the game itself."

And so it was written. And so it was done.

There was, according to certain suppressed documents, a fourth figure present at this sacred gathering. The records—those that remain—refer to him only as "The Redacted" or, in whispered corridors, "He Who Stumbled." His name has been systematically removed from all official materials. What transpired that day remains shrouded in mystery, though the Foundation's charter does contain an unusual clause regarding "the permanent consequences of questioning the serve."`,

      year: "Years One Through Three - The Expansion",
      title: "The Peasant Protocols",
      content: `As the Society's glory spread across the land, it became apparent that the Founders required... opposition. Not worthy opposition, mind you—that would be presumptuous—but bodies capable of holding rackets and receiving serves.

Thus, the Peasant Program was established. Candidates were selected based on criteria including: willingness to lose gracefully, ability to retrieve balls from corners, and an understanding that their role was fundamentally decorative.

Ludvig, Joel, and Hampus emerged from this rigorous selection process, each demonstrating the exact combination of enthusiasm and mediocrity that the Society required. They were granted the privilege of membership, along with a comprehensive document outlining their responsibilities (seventeen pages) and their rights (one bullet point: "access to hydration").

It should be noted that the Peasant Program was originally designed to accommodate four members. The fourth position remains vacant, its original occupant having suffered what official records describe only as "an injury of suspicious circumstances." Internal memos suggest The Redacted was removed after a contentious line call in which he dared suggest the ball was "out" when facing Viktor.`,

      year: "Years Four and Five - The Golden Age",
      title: "When Legends Played as Gods",
      content: `These years saw the Society reach unprecedented heights. The Monday Sessions became the stuff of legend—four hours of exquisite tennis followed by sauna discussions that shaped the very fabric of the club's philosophy.

It was during this period that Gerard achieved his famous "Perfect Month," in which he won every single point played in November 2021. The Peasants spoke of this time in hushed tones, referring to it simply as "The Reckoning."

Kockum developed his signature "Parliament of Angles" strategy, a geometric approach to tennis that opponents described as "mathematically humiliating." Viktor perfected what became known as the "Velvet Execution"—a drop shot so gentle, so perfectly placed, that opponents often thanked him for the privilege of witnessing it.

The vacant fourth position in both Royalty and Peasant ranks remained a subject that members learned not to discuss. A new member once asked about "the empty chair" at the Society dinner. He was not invited back.`,

      year: "Year Six - The Constitution",
      title: "Laws Written in Terra Cotta",
      content: `Understanding that greatness requires structure, the Founders codified the Sacred Laws of the Society:

Article I: The Monday Session is inviolable. Work, family, and national emergencies are not valid excuses.

Article II: The Noble Standard shall be calculated and respected. A score below 5.0 brings shame upon one's lineage.

Article III: All disputes shall be settled by the Founders, whose judgment is final, correct, and retrospectively justified.

Article IV: [REDACTED BY ORDER OF THE TRIBUNAL]

Article V: The Sauna is sacred. What is discussed in the Sauna stays in the Sauna, except for material useful for gentle blackmail.

Article IV, it is whispered, originally concerned "provisions for the rehabilitation of exiled members." Its removal coincided with the final disappearance of The Redacted from all Society functions. Some say he still practices his serve alone, on courts far from here, waiting for a redemption that will never come.`,

      year: "Year Seven - The Present Day",
      title: "The Eternal Reign Continues",
      content: `As we enter our seventh glorious year, the Society stands stronger than ever. The Leaderboard is maintained with religious precision. The Noble Standard guides all conduct. The Peasants remain appropriately grateful.

New traditions have emerged: the Annual Ceremonial Restringing, the Midsummer Ball Retrieval Festival, and the solemn Reading of the Match Statistics on the winter solstice.

The empty position remains unfilled. Some say it serves as a warning. Others suggest it honors a memory that cannot be spoken. The Founders simply smile when asked, a smile that somehow manages to be simultaneously warm and deeply unsettling.

The clay courts of TKSTL have borne witness to seven years of triumph, tradition, and the occasional mysterious disappearance. As Gerard himself declared at the last Annual Assembly: "We do not play tennis. Tennis, in its truest form, plays us."

Long may the Society reign.`,

  theRedacted: {
    title: "CLASSIFIED ADDENDUM",
    content: `The following information is classified at the highest level of Society clearance.

Subject: The Fourth Founder
Designation: The Redacted / He Who Stumbled
Status: [PERMANENTLY REMOVED]

The individual known as The Redacted was present at the Society's founding but was subsequently expunged from all official records following "The Incident" of Year Three. Details of this event are sealed, though fragments suggest it involved:

- A disputed line call during a crucial match
- Questions raised about the legitimacy of certain victory claims
- An "injury" that medical professionals described as "unusually convenient"
- A resignation letter that witnesses claim "wrote itself"

His name is not to be spoken within Society grounds. His locker has been bricked over. His trophies have been "redistributed."

Some say he watches the Monday Sessions from the parking lot. Others claim to have seen his ghostly figure practicing serves at midnight. The Founders neither confirm nor deny these reports.

All that remains is a single entry in the original founding charter, subsequently crossed out in what appears to be ceremonial ink: "And the fourth pillar of our Society shall be—" The rest is illegible, as if the very paper rejected the name.
